# awesome-progressbar-widget

An awesome widget (3.4 only). Based on blingbling widgets. Horribly unoptimised, has bugs.


Features:
* Fixed-size progressbar with visual track progress and track name
* On-click notification with track, artist name, cover etc.

Requires oocairo and lgi because awesome 3.4 sucks.
